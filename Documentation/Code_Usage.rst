Code Usage

This section demonstrates how to use the code to solve USGS/SECE benchmark problems TPV3, TPV5, TPV6, and TPV7.

Kernel Data
***************

We have provided the precomputed Kernels for the USGS/SCEC benchmark problems TPV3, TPV5, TPV6, and TPV7, along with the mesh size we chose to solve the problems. 

However, if you want to compute the kernels, a separate directory with the source code is provided. One can generate the Kernels using the following steps::

  cd TBSBIEM
  cd src_Kernels
  make
  cd ..
  ./Kernel_Check
  
One can also generate the Kernels during the simulation.  
  
Just provide '0' at `Pre_Kernels` prompt in the input file, the code will generate and store in a directory given, like `TPV5_Kernels`, for example.


**Note:** If you provide '1' at the `Pre_Kernels` prompt in the input file, the code will search for kernels with no kernels generated. Thus, be cautious when generating the kernels; provide '0' at the `Pre_Kernels` prompt in the input file.

Running a Simulation
*********************
The code is provided with several input files to solve USGS/SCEC benchmark problems. Namely, TPV3, TPV5, TPV6 and TPV7. One can solve these benchmark problems changing a problem name in **TPV_Problem.in** file.

For example, if you want to solve the TPV6 problem, then store the string::

   TPV6

in the file **Test_Problem.in**

Compile and execute the code::

      cd TBSBIEM
      cd src
      make
      cd ..
      ./TBSBIEM-v1.1.0


The problem TPV6 will be solved, and the data will be stored in the directory './data'.

Now, if you would like to run the TPV5 problem, just change the input string in the file **Test_Problem.in** to::

   TPV6

Now, just execute the code:: 

      ./TBSBIEM-v1.1.0

The problem TPV5 will be solved, and the data will be stored in the directory './data'.

Post-Processing
********************* 
We have provided GNUPLOT scripts and the benchmark data for the MDSBI code, covering TPV3, TPV5, TPV6, and TPV7, to plot various field variables at specific station points. The plots generated from the scripts provide a comparison of results from TBSBIEM and MDSBI.

For post-processing of results of TBSBIEM, we have provided two gnuplot codes in the './Post_Processing' directory. The first code **TPV_Contour_Plots.pg** creates the contour for slip, slip-rate, :math:'\ tau_1, \tau_2` and :math:'\ tau_3` with a time interval of 0.5 Seconds. The second code, **TPV_Station_Plots.pg**, will generate a comparison of field variables at station points with MDSBI results.

You can use the following command to generate the contour plots::

   gnuplot TPV_Contour_Plots.pg

You can use the following command to generate the plots of field variables at different stataion points::

   gnuplot TPV_Station_Plots.pg

.. For a quick plotting one can use the gnuplot script given below to plot the contour plots on the fault plane as::

..   for i in {0001..0015}; do    gnuplot -e "set terminal jpeg; set hidden3d; set xlabel 'x1 (km)'; set ylabel 'x3 (km)'; set zlabel 'Slip (m)'; set xrange [-15:15]; set yrange [-7.5:7.5];   set zrange [0.0:0.5]; set cbrange [0.0:0.5]; set view map; splot './data/TPV3_Out$i.dat' u 2:3:4 ps 0.1 palette" > Slip_Top$i.jpeg; done 
   
.. The example script generate a contour plot of rupture front with duration intervel of 0.5 Sec on  the fault plan for TPV3 benchmark problem.

.. Or we have given gnuplot script in './Post_Processing' directory using which one can generate the contour plot with time intervel of 1 Sec. One need to change the variable *Problem_no* to respective TPV problem required to plot out of 3,5,6 and 7.

.. One can create an interesting video using ffmpeg cammand as::

..    ffmpeg -r 10 -i Slip_Top%04d.jpeg  -vf "fps=10" Slip_Top.mp4
   
**Note:** To plot these figure and the video generation one needs to install gnuplot and ffmpeg. The installation commands are as follows::

   sudo apt update
   sudo apt upgrade
   sudo apt install gnuplot  
   sudo apt install ffmpeg -y
