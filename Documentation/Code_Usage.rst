Code Usage
#############
This section demonstrates how to use the code to solve USGS/SECE benchmark problems TPV3, TPV5, TPV6, and TPV7.

Each parameter can be changed and a new input file can be fed for solving problems.



Kernel Data
***************

We have provided the precomputed Kernels for USGS/SCEC benchmark problems TPV3, TPV5, TPV6, and TPV7 with the mesh size that we have choosen to solve the problem. 

However, if you want to compute the kernels, a separate directory with source code is provided. One can generate the Kernels using the following steps::

  cd TBSBIEM
  cd src_Kernels
  make
  cd ..
  ./Kernel_Check
  
or one can generate the Kernels during the simulation as well.  
  
Just provide '0' at `Pre_Kernels` prompt in the input file, the code will generate and store in a directory given like `TPV5_Kernels` for example.


**Note:** If you provide '1' at `Pre_Kernels` prompt in the input file, the code will search for kernels with no kernels generated. Thus be carefull if you need to generate the kernels, provide '0' at `Pre_Kernels` prompt in the input file.


Running a Simulation
*********************
The code is provided with several input files to solve USGS/SCEC benchmark problems. Namely, TPV3, TPV5, TPV6 and TPV7. One can solve these benchmark problems changing a problem name in **TPV_Problem.in** file.

For example, if you want to solve TPV6 problem then store the string::

   TPV6

in the file **Test_Problem.in**

Compile and execute the code::

      cd TBSBIEM
      cd src
      make
      cd ..
      ./TBSBIEM-v1.1.0


The problem TPV6 will be solved and the data will be stored in the directory './data'.

Post-Processing
********************* 
For a quick plotting one can use the gnuplot script given below to plot the contour plots on the fault plane as::

   for i in {0001..0015}; do    gnuplot -e "set terminal jpeg; set hidden3d; set xlabel 'x1 (km)'; set ylabel 'x3 (km)'; set zlabel 'Slip (m)'; set xrange [-15:15]; set yrange [-7.5:7.5];   set zrange [0.0:0.5]; set cbrange [0.0:0.5]; set view map; splot './data/TPV3_Out$i.dat' u 2:3:4 ps 0.1 palette" > Slip_Top$i.jpeg; done 
   
The example script generate a contour plot of rupture front with duration intervel of 0.5 Sec on  the fault plan for TPV3 benchmark problem.

Or we have given gnuplot script in './Post_Processing' directory using which one can generate the contour plot with time intervel of 1 Sec. One need to change the variable *Problem_no* to respective TPV problem required to plot out of 3,5,6 and 7.

One can create an interesting video using ffmpeg cammand as::

   ffmpeg -r 10 -i Slip_Top%04d.jpeg  -vf "fps=10" Slip_Top.mp4
   
**Note:** To plot these figure and the video generation one needs to install gnuplot and ffmpeg. The installation commands are as follows::

   sudo apt update
   sudo apt upgrade
   sudo apt install gnuplot  
   sudo apt install ffmpeg -y


Comparison of Results
----------------------------
We have provided GNUPLOT scripts and the benchmark data of MDBSI code for TPV3, TPV5, TPV6, and TPV7 to plot the various field variables at specific station points. The plots generated from the scripts provides the comparison of results from TBSBIEM and MDSBI.
